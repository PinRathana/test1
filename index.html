        <h1>Introduction to HTML!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the world of code!<br>Last year, millions of learners from our community started with HTML.</p>
        <p>Why?<br><strong>HTML is the skeleton of all web pages.</strong> It's often the first language learned by 
           developers, marketers, and designers and is core to front-end development work.</p>
        <p>HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as
            <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/img/image.png">images</a>, text, or 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKc1GFvhU5I">videos</a>.</p>
